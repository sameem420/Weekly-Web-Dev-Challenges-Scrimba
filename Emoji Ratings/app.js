DESCRIPTION:
You job is to enable users to give a rating between 1 (bad) and 5 (great), 
and then display that rating in the form of an emoji. The users should give 
their ratings by pressing a key on their keyboards (the numbers 1 to 5). 
Here's the numbers' corresponding emojis:

5 = 😁
3 = 🙂
3 = 😐
2 = ☹️
1 = 🤬

event listeners, keyboard events, key codes, 
focus, focusout, DOM manipulation, tabindex

*/

const box = document.getElementById("box")
const text = document.getElementById("text")

box.addEventListener("focus", function(){
    text.textContent = "Type a number between 1 and 5"
})

box.addEventListener("focusout", function(){
    text.textContent = "Click here to give your rating"
})

const keyToEmoji = {
    53 : "😁",
    52 : "🙂",
    51 : "😐",
    50: "☹️",
    49 : "🤬"
}

// Write your code here 👇
box.addEventListener('keydown', (ev) => {
    text.textContent = keyToEmoji[ev.keyCode]
})


/*

DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS
1. Listen for keyboard events when the box has focus
2. Figure out which key the user pressed
3. If it's between 1 and 5, display an emoji in the box!

STRETCH GOALS:
- Animate the emoji onto the screen! Why not go crazy with multiple emojis? 
- Reset the entire app when box doesn't have focus anymore
- Can you improve the overall design?
